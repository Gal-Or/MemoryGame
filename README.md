# MemoryGame
Exercise 2 in the Internet Technologies course.
This project involves html, CSS, JS programming, reading and writing from JSON file and animations.

## Description

This project is a memory game.
With each new game the order of the cards on the board changes randomly each time.
The game is continuous so that the number of winning games is recorded to win each of the participants from game to game.
All game data is stored in JSON.

The game board can first be set in 4X4 or 5X5 sizes and with the names of the participants.
The game display contains the names of the two players appearing in the game display after entering, the card board and the accumulation of points at each stage (changes as the game progresses).
